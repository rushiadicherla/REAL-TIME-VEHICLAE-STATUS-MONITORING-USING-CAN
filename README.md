CAN Vehicle Monitoring Simulation - README
------------------------------------------
This project is a C-based embedded systems application that implements multiple hardware interface modules including:
ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion)
CAN (Controller Area Network) communication
LCD display interface
I2C communication
Interrupt handling
Node-based system architecture (e.g., MAIN_NODE, FUEL_NODE, INDICATOR_NODE)
It is designed for microcontroller environments and can be adapted for various automotive, industrial, or IoT use cases.

FEATURES
------------------------------------------
Modular design with separate .c and .h files for each peripheral.
CAN bus communication support.
LCD display output for system status.
I2C communication for sensor/device interfacing.
External interrupt support for real-time responsiveness.
Example node programs to demonstrate integration.
